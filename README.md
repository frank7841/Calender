## Description
{Exact day of birth calculator website is a landing page with a brief description of what the website is about, It also describes the Akan naming system and displays the coreesponding male and Female Akan names to the days of the week.
## Setup/Installation Requirements

* For older Chrome , allow javaScript in the settings> prefference section.
{Navigate to Day Calculator folder, launch index.html open with chrome browser. incase of any edits, open with vscode twext editor}
## Known Bugs
{The website is not responsive to all viewports
The system doesnt calculate every exact day depending on the user inputs eg  2002,2,7}
## Technologies Used
{I used 'css', 'javaScript', bootstrap' and 'html' to create the website.}
## Behavior Driven Development
{the program should take date ,month, year, and gender,it then uses the formulae below 
**( ( (CC/4) -2*CC-1) + ((5*YY/4) ) + ((26*(MM+1)/10)) + DD ) mod 7**
where CC is the Centuary year;
yy is the year  ie 2022
cc===20
yy==22
mm is the month you were born
dd is the date
mod is %
the pogram should check to ensure that month, date , and year values enterd are numbers.
for the case of date, it should qualify the expression **0<date<=31**
for the case of Month, it should return true for the expression **0<month<=12**
It then outputs the akan name of the user.
}
# specifics 
{The user inputs  year, month, date and selects gender. The scripts run and outputs the Akan name of the user depending on the day he or she was born. The day of the week is attributed from the formulae above . If it results to ), then the user was born on Sunday, is 1 then the user was born on Monday and so on till Saturday.
